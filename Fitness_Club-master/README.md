# Fitness_Club
Fitness Club is a GYM managment application that is used by the Admin, Trainer and Trainee

The project aims to develop a GYM Management System that will handle all the necessary and minute
details easily and provide the proper database security accordingly to the user. The main purpose
of the system is to automate the GYM center so that it can make the trainers and trainees data and 
schedule easily accessible and also making it easy to keep records in a secure database. The database
will hold the information about trainers, trainees, registrations, schedules and all the transactions 
that occur in GYM and lock-up with the graphical user interface. It also provides the facility of search
and advanced search for searching the records efficiently and immediately. This system provides an ease 
for the gym owner to manage the gym center without any hustle.
